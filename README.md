# langchain-mini-rag
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with LangChain. This project loads documents (PDF/DOCX), chunks them into overlapping segments, generates embeddings using OpenAI, and stores them in a Chroma vector database. Includes a retriever that performs semantic similarity search to return the most relevant document chunks for a query.
